# DLSG: Deep Learning GS

Hello, my name is George Studenko (GS) and I'm creating this library of snippets to facilitate even more deep learning development, ideally this library will contain small snippets of code that should follow best practices and hopefully be well optimized as far as my knowledge gets.

DLGS is a python libraby that you can import and start using from your projects straight away.

## Using DLGS
